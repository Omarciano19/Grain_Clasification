# Grain1
Simple classification ML algorithm to sort grain

## First we got the data from grainspace: https://github.com/hellodfan/GrainSpace
we will focus mainly in the M600 data, which is collected with smartphones cameras, focusing on simplicity
then i'll switch to G600 which is collected with industrial cameras, focusing  precision.

So far there's a preprocess algorithm, with resizes and normalizes images of maize.
